##### EDDU TRACK

This is a application that allows lecturers create attendance code for students to mark after attending classes. The attendance code is tie to the number of students and expires when that number is reached.

The application will also allow the grading of students assessment by lecturers (they can use the attendance sheet to track students and know when a percentage of classes has been attended).

We aim to provide an application not only for attendance and grades, but also for classes scheduling by lecturers and certification minting at the end of a programme.

This will always help for future references and job opportunities for students, as they can always present their onchain data to future employees.
